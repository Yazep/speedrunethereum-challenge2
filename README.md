# Token Vendor Challenge Solution

I successfully completed üö© **Challenge 2: Token Vendor** as part of my journey through SpeedRunEthereum challenges. This challenge deepened my understanding of smart contracts and their capabilities, simulating a "vending machine" for digital currencies on the Ethereum blockchain.

![Challenge 2 Overview](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges/assets/55535804/b427171f-3f20-41a5-b76f-05d67e2b9959)

## Key Learnings

- **ERC20 Token Creation**: Created `YourToken.sol` inheriting the ERC20 standard, minting 1000 tokens to the deploying address, understanding the mechanics of token minting and initial distribution.
- **Smart Contract Interactions**: Developed a `Vendor.sol` contract for buying and selling the custom ERC20 tokens, learning about contract-to-contract interactions and the importance of the "approve" pattern in ERC20 tokens.
- **Frontend Integration**: Modified the frontend to interact with the smart contracts, allowing users to buy tokens, approve transactions, and sell tokens back to the vendor, enhancing my skills in creating user-friendly decentralized applications.

## Deployments

The challenge culminated in deploying the Dapp to a public testnet and hosting the frontend on a public web server, making the application accessible for real-world use and interaction.

- **ERC20 Token**: Implemented and deployed an ERC20 token, understanding the standard and its functions.
- **Token Vendor**: Created a vending machine-like contract that buys and sells the custom token, grasping the nuances of smart contract development and Ethereum transactions.
- **Frontend Application**: Integrated the smart contracts with a React-based frontend, providing a seamless interface for user interactions.

## Conclusion

Completing this challenge was a significant step forward in my blockchain development journey, consolidating my understanding of Ethereum, smart contracts, and Dapp development. It was an invaluable experience in learning about token standards, contract interactions, and the complexities of deploying and interacting with smart contracts on a public blockchain.
